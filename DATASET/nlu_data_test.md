- Hello, so i've been trying to reduce noise in some astrophotography photos I took the other day in death valley and when I load them into photoshop from Lightroom as edit in photoshop as layers.

- Is there any way to [convert](action) a [layers](object_1) with a layer mask into a [smart object](object_2) without the layer mask thumbnail disappearing on Photoshop CC? I understand that the mask thumbnail still appears if the mask was applied AFTER the original image was converted to a smart object but I, very stupidly, forgot to do this and have now gotten too far into editing my layers to start the process again. I know that the layer mask can still be edited when the smart object is opened in a separate window however it is important in my case that the layer mask is obvious and editable within the original document.
- I'm new to editing videos in PS. I've got that when making a global adjustment to all the frames I need to [convert](action) to [smart object](object_2).

- I have a text [layer](object_1), when I [convert](action) it to [smart object](object_2) OR rasterize it OR merge then it becomes BOLDER nad more pixelated / blocky then original text layer.

- I have a main layer and 4 layers above it adding in pieces of the image for an overall composite.  I then [turned](action) my main [layer](object_1) into a [Smart Object](object_2).  Then I went to Filter> Camera Raw Filter to create a non-destructive filter for modifying exposure, hue etc for the composite image.  But I see that this filter affects only the main layer and the other, additional layers are not showing in the Camera Raw Filter screen on the image.  Can I create a non-destructive filter in Camera Raw that will affect my entire image without merging the layers, or is that necessary?  Thank you.
- Hello, I [created](action), and imported some custom [profiles](object_1) in [Camera Raw](object_2). When I open a raw image, I can click on profiles and they all show up.

- how can i NEF files with Photomerge (3-4Fotos) [created](action) open in [Camera Raw](object_1)?
- I'm [creating](action) [profiles](object_1) in PS [camera RAW](object_2) using the "new profile" dialog by alt clicking on the "new preset" icon. When I save the profile it stores the new profile (.xmp) in the path "C:\Users\Michael\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CameraRaw\Settings", which is fine for PS, but Lightroom cannot "see" this path in it's profile browser when it starts up. Lightroom is looking in the path "C:\ProgramData\Adobe\CameraRaw\Settings" for profiles.

- The perspective tool isn't working right for me. When I try and outline the [image](object_1), it won't let me release the corners in the correct location. I am using [windows 10](OS) with a wacom tablet. I've updated my drivers for my video card and my tablet, I'm using Photoshop [CC](version) 2019 and I've updated windows. But it doesn't change anything. I'm not sure what else to try. Because it's hard to explain, I've attached a screenshot to show where the cursor tries to go, it either goes way outside the picture, or inside of it and it's very jerky in it's movement. I hope that makes sense and someone can help me.
- I have a shot that has two perspective issues. I've tried free [transform](action) and lens correction (which improved it somewhat) but I want to fully correct these problems.

- I [select](action) an [area](object_1) I want to transform with the [lasso tool](object_2), I choose an item from the Transform menu (i.e "scale" or "skew",) and the transformation box appears around the entire picture, rather than the selected area. It will only allow me to transform the entire layer, not just the selected area. However, moving the selected area with the move tool works just fine. The problem just started today. Searching has only led me to find basic descriptions of how to transform in Photoshop. I've been using the program for years and I've never had this problem. I'm guessing I checked or un-checked some box without realizing it. Any help is appreciated
