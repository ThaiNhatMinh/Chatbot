- When I convert layers to a smart object, the default canvas it's on is the size of the original canvas rather than the size of the object--I alawys have to go into the smart object file and crop it--is there anyway to change this default?
- I am trying to get the active layer to convert to a smart object via script.
-   I am trying to create a script that converts the selected embedded smart object layer into a linked smart object by bringing up a "save as" dialog so the user can direct where to saved the linked smart object to, each time the script runs. So far I've been able to find this script which converts an embedded smart object to a linked smart object and saves it to a predefined path:
- Hello, so i've been trying to reduce noise in some astrophotography photos I took the other day in death valley and when I load them into photoshop from Lightroom as edit in photoshop as layers. I can no longer choose selected layers and convert them into a smart object.
- Is there any way to convert a layer with a layer mask into a smart object without the layer mask thumbnail disappearing on Photoshop CC? I understand that the mask thumbnail still appears if the mask was applied AFTER the original image was converted to a smart object but I, very stupidly, forgot to do this and have now gotten too far into editing my layers to start the process again. I know that the layer mask can still be edited when the smart object is opened in a separate window however it is important in my case that the layer mask is obvious and editable within the original document.
- I'm new to editing videos in PS. I've got that when making a global adjustment to all the frames I need to convert to smart object. My problem is that having edited with the layer going purple in the time line (smart object) I then can't review the whole video by hitting play on the timeline without the frame rate going red and settling at a ridiculous 8-9fps.
- I have a text layer, when I convert it to smart object OR rasterize it OR merge then it becomes BOLDER nad more pixelated / blocky then original text layer. I use photoshop CC and I never noticed such a problem in Photoshop CS5. Problem occursregardless of the setting of text anti-aliasing.

- I've been able yo open any files with the CAMERA RAW FILTER under the filter menu, but sddenly I can't any more. Have I managed to turn off the filter, or what I am doing wrong? One minute it worked, next - nada.
- I have a main layer and 4 layers above it adding in pieces of the image for an overall composite.  I then turned my main layer into a Smart Object.  Then I went to Filter> Camera Raw Filter to create a non-destructive filter for modifying exposure, hue etc for the composite image.  But I see that this filter affects only the main layer and the other, additional layers are not showing in the Camera Raw Filter screen on the image.  Can I create a non-destructive filter in Camera Raw that will affect my entire image without merging the layers, or is that necessary?  Thank you.
- Hello, I created, and imported some custom profiles in Camera Raw. When I open a raw image, I can click on profiles and they all show up. However, if I'm already in photoshop, and attempt to apply a Camera Raw Filter, none of the custom profiles are listed—only the Adobe defaults. Why is this and how do I fix it?
- how can i NEF files with Photomerge (3-4Fotos) created open in Camera Raw?
- I'm creating profiles in PS camera RAW using the "new profile" dialog by alt clicking on the "new preset" icon. When I save the profile it stores the new profile (.xmp) in the path "C:\Users\Michael\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CameraRaw\Settings", which is fine for PS, but Lightroom cannot "see" this path in it's profile browser when it starts up. Lightroom is looking in the path "C:\ProgramData\Adobe\CameraRaw\Settings" for profiles.
- is there maybe a plug in that provides better image rotation and scaling ? Anything that matches one photo to another ? Selecting source and destination points would be super.
- Is there a possibility to rotate an image in the select and mask taskspace?
- I am using Adobe Photoshop CC and I need to know how to rotate an image.

- In Extendscript, how would one crop image to the current selection? Thank you!

- I have an image (shown) that i have partly straightened in LR. However, as you can see, since it is a global straighten, not every is as vertical as I would wish. Is it possible to straighten just the right-hand vertical without affecting the other parts (left) of the castle?
- I am following a study book, it says to straighten a picture. It says to select straighten tool and to make sure content-aware is selected. I have tried this several times and the content-aware box is blacked out and it cannot be selected. When I straighten the image, it leaves white areas around the picture, whereas the book says they should be filled since the content aware option is checked.

- I bought the photography plan two days ago, and every time I try to download photoshop it aborts after somewhere between 5 and 50%. I'm able to download lightroom but not photoshop. I've tried to uninstall adobe, and I've tried to use the cleaner tool, but it doesn't help. I still get the same message. Error code 151. "unable to create the symbolic link" I can't figure out what the problem is. I've spent hours chatting with the adobe help center in India, 3 different persons, and they can't figure out either.

Do I have to reset the mac for some reason? Best, Petter
- I created a portfolio with adobe photoshop after editing for 3 days and published I can no longer find my pf to log in as if it never existed. it starts me over to create another new pf but when I type the link in the address bar it shows up
- When trying to open in Photoshop an Adobe stock template downloaded to their Windows 10 machine , an error  window with text "unexpected end-of-file" encountered.
- This may be a stupid question but I am very new to photo shop. I have created a bunch combined pictures using adobe stock photos and completed them prior to purchase so they have the photo shop watermark on them, now I have purchased the licence to the photos and the watermarks are still there on my completed work.
- The perspective tool isn't working right for me. When I try and outline the image, it won't let me release the corners in the correct location. I am using windows 10 with a wacom tablet. I've updated my drivers for my video card and my tablet, I'm using Photoshop CC 2019 and I've updated windows. But it doesn't change anything. I'm not sure what else to try. Because it's hard to explain, I've attached a screenshot to show where the cursor tries to go, it either goes way outside the picture, or inside of it and it's very jerky in it's movement. I hope that makes sense and someone can help me.
- I have a shot that has two perspective issues. I've tried free transform and lens correction (which improved it somewhat) but I want to fully correct these problems. In the image below, the vertical line of the Cooks Window is tilting inward and the counter has an upward curve. How do I make these straight and perpendicular to each other without warping the parts of the image that seem ok? Thanks!
- I select an area I want to transform with the lasso tool, I choose an item from the Transform menu (i.e "scale" or "skew",) and the transformation box appears around the entire picture, rather than the selected area. It will only allow me to transform the entire layer, not just the selected area. However, moving the selected area with the move tool works just fine. The problem just started today. Searching has only led me to find basic descriptions of how to transform in Photoshop. I've been using the program for years and I've never had this problem. I'm guessing I checked or un-checked some box without realizing it. Any help is appreciated
